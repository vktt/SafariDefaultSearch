# SafariDefaultSearch
Change Safari's Default Search Engine

1. Turn on Extension
2. Go to Safari's preferences, Search tab, change search engine to Ecosia

Now Safari will use Brave as the default search engine.

To change search engine, change 'search.brave.com' (from SafariDefaultSearch Extension/SafariExtensionHandler.swift) to other URL.
